#### Synopsis:
This project conducts analysis of Premier League data in R. The data spans from the 2003/2004 season to the 2015/2016 season. The analysis contains summary statistics, visualizations, machine learning, and really anything I found interesting. Results are presented in an RMarkdown document ('Premier League Analysis').

#### Motivation:
I created this project to display an example of a complete analysis result.

#### Dataset Details:
The dataset contains data on the Premier League from the 2003/2004 season to the 2015/2016 season. Quantities recorded include half-time score, full-time (end of the game) score, various match statistics, and various betting odds on the game.
The data can be found at:
http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php

The data folder contains 1 file for each season. The 'data_aggregation.R' file creates a single data file from the season files. Running 'data_aggregation.R' yields 'premier_data.csv', which is used for the analysis.

Details of the analysis run are in 'Premier League Analysis'.
